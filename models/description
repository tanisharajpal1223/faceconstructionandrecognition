This code snippet demonstrates how to use a pre-trained FaceNet model for face recognition.
 Here's a breakdown of what it does:

Loading the Pre-trained FaceNet Model:
It loads a pre-trained FaceNet model using TensorFlow/Keras from the file 'facenet_model.h5'.

Preprocessing and Extracting Faces:
 Assuming you have a list of face images stored in face_images, the code preprocesses these images
 (e.g., resizing, normalization) to prepare them for face recognition. The function preprocess_faces()
  is not defined in the provided snippet but would typically handle these preprocessing steps.

Obtaining Embeddings:
The preprocessed faces are passed through the loaded FaceNet model to obtain embeddings
(i.e., feature vectors) for each face image.

Calculating Distance between Embeddings:
The distance() function calculates the Euclidean distance between two embeddings,
which is a measure of dissimilarity.

Comparing Embeddings for Face Recognition:
The code compares the embeddings of different face images to recognize faces.
 It iterates over all pairs of embeddings and checks if the distance between them
 falls below a certain threshold (distance_threshold). If the distance is below the threshold,
  the code considers the faces to belong to the same person; otherwise,
   it considers them to belong to different people.

This approach assumes that faces belonging to the same person will have embeddings
that are closer together in the embedding space compared to faces belonging to different people.
Adjusting the distance_threshold allows you to control the sensitivity of the face recognition system.

To use this code, make sure you have a pre-trained FaceNet model saved as 'facenet_model.h5'
and define the preprocess_faces() function to preprocess your face images appropriately.
 Additionally, you may need to adjust the distance_threshold based on your specific requirements
 and the characteristics of your dataset.


 The "FaceNet model" mentioned in the code refers to a specific neural network architecture
 developed for face recognition tasks.
 FaceNet was introduced by researchers at Google in a paper titled "FaceNet: A Unified
 Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering" by Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko, and James Philbin.

The FaceNet model is trained to generate high-dimensional embeddings (feature vectors)
 from face images such that similar faces are mapped to nearby points in the embedding space.
  This enables effective face recognition by comparing the distances between embeddings.

The "facenet_model.h5" file mentioned in the code likely contains the weights and architecture
of a pre-trained FaceNet model in the HDF5 format, which is a file format commonly used to store trained Keras models.
